# UsefulBits

### A Collection of Useful Cocoa and UIKit Bits

Setup
-----

In order to build the project you'll need be using xcode 4 and have the [iOS-Universal-Framework](https://github.com/kstenerud/iOS-Universal-Framework/ "iOS-Universal-Framework") **real** framework template installed. 

Then just add the project to your xcode workspace (you are using workspaces aren't you) and you're away.

Usage
-----

For now you have to explore by yourself. Most things are pretty self explanatory (that is if
you share my particular form of madness). If something doesn't work for you or something doesn't
make sense (I did mention that I'm a little insane, *Out, damn'd spot! out, I say!*) reach out to me on twitter [@kevinoneill](http://twitter.com/kevinoneill "@kevinoneill")

*Look out for a blog post or two coming soon*
